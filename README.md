## Usage

```javascript
import copy from "fast-copy";
import { deepEqual } from "fast-equals";

const object = {
  array: [123, { deep: "value" }],
  map: new Map([["foo", {}], [{ bar: "baz" }, "quz"]])
};

const copiedObject = copy(object);

console.log(copiedObject === object); // false
console.log(deepEqual(copiedObject, object)); // true
```

## Types supported

The following object types are deeply cloned when they are either properties on the object passed, or the object itself:

* `Array`
* `ArrayBuffer`
* `BigInt`
* `Buffer`
* `DataView`
* `Date`
* `Float32Array`
* `Float64Array`
* `Int8Array`
* `Int16Array`
* `Int32Array`
* `Map`
* `Object`
* `RegExp`
* `Set`
* `Uint8Array`
* `Uint8ClampedArray`
* `Uint16Array`
* `Uint32Array`
* `React` components
* Custom constructors

The following object types are copied directly, as they are either primitives, cannot be cloned, or the common use-case implementation does not expect cloning:

* `AsyncFunction`
* `Boolean`
* `Error`
* `Function`
* `GeneratorFunction`
* `Number`
* `Null`
* `Promise`
* `String`
* `Symbol`
* `Undefined`
* `WeakMap`
* `WeakSet`

Circular objects are supported out of the box as well. By default a cache based on `WeakSet` is used, but if `WeakSet` is not available then a standard `Object` fallback is used. The benchmarks quoted below are based on use of `WeakSet`.

## Benchmarks

#### Simple objects

_Small number of properties, all values are primitives_

## Development

Standard practice, clone the repo and `npm i` to get the dependencies. The following npm scripts are available:

* benchmark => run benchmark tests against other equality libraries
* build => build dist files with `rollup`
* clean => run `clean:dist`, `clean:es`, and `clean:lib` scripts
* clean:dist => run `rimraf` on the `dist` folder
* clean:es => run `rimraf` on the `es` folder
* clean:lib => run `rimraf` on the `lib` folder
* dev => start webpack playground App
* dist => run `build` and `build:minified` scripts
* lint => run ESLint on all files in `src` folder (also runs on `dev` script)
* lint:fix => run `lint` script, but with auto-fixer
* prepublish:compile => run `lint`, `test:coverage`, `transpile:lib`, `transpile:es`, and `dist` scripts
* start => run `dev`
* test => run AVA with NODE_ENV=test on all files in `test` folder
* test:coverage => run same script as `test` with code coverage calculation via `nyc`
* test:watch => run same script as `test` but keep persistent watcher
* transpile:es => run Babel on all files in `src` folder (transpiled to `es` folder without transpilation of ES2015 export syntax)
* transpile:lib => run Babel on all files in `src` folder (transpiled to `lib` folder)
